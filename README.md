# Peter personal Ocean website

Idea:
Okay my idea categories my website into like a cool nature adventure 

Theme is like cartoon ocean adventure 

## Section 0:

The header bar… this will allow you to choose what ever section you go to 

consist of 4 elements, Home, About me, Projects, Contact Me 

Idk think of cool ui/simple ui… 

## Section 1 Entry:

When you first spawn into the website we will have a background of waves(ocean), rather clouds moving in the background or a night sky with flashing stars 

however in the mist of all of this my info will slide in from a rain cloud
Which would rain down my information (this will be happending in the midground)

then my text would build itself along with a picture of myself(this would happend in the foreground)

### then as you Scroll or click the button you would be transported “under the ocean”(effect)

## Section 2: under the shallow water

The first section we have here would just be like somewhat under the sea… Then basically We will have my first section of About me 
Which would display my information rather from fish moving past it fast
or a submarine…
IN this section we would have just describe like me and what I do and enjoy etc etc 

### then as you Scroll or click the button you would be transported “under the ocean”(effect)

## Section 3: Deeper under the water

In this section we will have different fishes, now we have sharks… and idk like squids?
This is the Project section:
Here we will include different project (dont know how I will sort them)… and (fit with theme)

So for now Idk have a squid like ink out the entire project choose section(have a command that lets you type by langauge or something cool idk yet)

This will be Section 3.1

### then as you Scroll or click the button you would be transported “under the ocean”(effect)

## Section 4: The bottom

Here will just be about me page, where I will have like different shrimsp ro crabs maybe a treasure chest or something in the background…

Figure out cool ui and how you will display information

Maybe we have all the links (discord) (linkedin) (youtube) (email) in treasure chest that will open and pop out your information which would be cool 

Have them close again when we scroll up 

## Other effects:

I would like to choose between a light and dark mode slightly in the header bar… All this does… is change the text boxes or info stuff from light color to dark colors etc a

HOWEVER THE big change would be that it would change the sky from clouds and day into night and stars… thats really it idkkk its cool?
